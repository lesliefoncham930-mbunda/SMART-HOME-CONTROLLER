Project Overview

The Smart Home Controller is a student project designed to manage and automate home devices efficiently. The system enables users to control lighting, temperature, security systems, and other smart appliances from a centralized interface. This project demonstrates practical application of IoT (Internet of Things) concepts and basic automation logic.

Features

Device Control: Turn devices on/off and adjust settings.

Scheduling: Automate tasks based on time or events.

Remote Access: Control devices from a mobile or web interface.

Energy Monitoring: Track and optimize energy consumption.

Security Alerts: Receive notifications for unusual activity.

Technologies Used

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi)

Sensors (temperature, motion, light)

Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules for connectivity

Programming languages: Python, C++, or relevant IoT frameworks

Optional: Mobile/Web interface for remote control

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Set up the microcontroller and sensors according to the hardware guide.

Install necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Upload the code to the microcontroller.

Connect devices to the smart home network.

Usage

Access the controller via the web or mobile interface.

Add devices to the system.

Configure schedules and automation rules.

Monitor energy usage and receive notifications.

Future Improvements

Integration with voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant)

Advanced AI-based automation

Expanded device compatibility
